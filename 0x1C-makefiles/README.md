Introduction to Makefiles
This README provides an introduction to Makefiles, a powerful tool for automating the build process of your software projects. Makefiles are particularly useful in managing complex projects with multiple source files and dependencies.

What is a Makefile?
A Makefile is a simple text file that contains a set of rules for building your project. These rules specify how to compile source code, link object files, and create the final executable or other output files.

Why Use Makefiles?
Makefiles offer several benefits:

Automation: Makefiles automate the build process, making it easy to recompile your project after changes without manually specifying all the compilation steps.

Dependency Management: Makefiles help manage dependencies, ensuring that only modified source files are recompiled. This can save a lot of time during development.

Consistency: Makefiles ensure that everyone working on the project follows the same build process, reducing potential errors and inconsistencies.

Anatomy of a Makefile
A typical Makefile consists of the following components:

Variables: Define variables for compiler options, source files, and other project-specific information.

Targets: Specify the output files to be generated (e.g., executable binaries).

Dependencies: Define the files and commands required to build each target.

Rules: Specify how to create the target from its dependencies.

Comments: Add comments to explain the purpose of various sections within the Makefile.

Getting Started
Prerequisites: Ensure that you have Make installed on your system. You can check by running make --version.

Create a Makefile: Start by creating a Makefile in your project's root directory. You can use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to create this file.

Writing Rules: Define the variables, targets, dependencies, and rules specific to your project. Use the example Makefile provided in this repository as a reference.

Running Make: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Makefile. To build your project, simply run the make command. Make will automatically handle the build process based on your rules.

Example Makefile
For a basic example of a Makefile, please refer to the provided Makefile.example in this repository.

Conclusion
Makefiles are a fundamental tool for managing and automating the build process of software projects. With this introduction, you should be equipped to create and use Makefiles in your own projects. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
